# PiPrecious
PiPrecious is meant to store experiment conditions + various capture files. 
[PiRanha](https://github.com/PiRanhaLysis/PiRanha) is meant to automatically setup/reproduce an experiment environment (based on references stored in PiPrecious) 
and do the network capture. An experiment is, for the moment, defined by a smartphone, a mobile application and an IoT device (optional).
You can run an experiment multiple times, each run is a Session. A session stores PCAP, FLOW and Bluetooth dumps.
